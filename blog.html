          I suck at writing :(. But there's no better way to get better than by

        <h2>Paradigm Shift: All numbers are random variables.</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Aug 6, 2025</p>
        <p>
          I've recently had a paradigm shift, that has bridged 'probability'
          (which I usually think of as a foreign sort of math) and 'regular
          math' (alebgra, calculus, etc). All the numbers we deal with in
          'regular math' (be it constants or coefficients like 2 and 3.79), can
          all be thought of as RANDOM variables (just like how we consider x,y,
          and z to be variables). It's just that these real numbers/constants
          are typically "deterministic" variables, i.e. we know their values
          with complete certainty. But say you had an equation y= 2x+3 (you're
          trying to model some linear relationship) and you got those
          coefficient values (2 and 3) from your friend. Say this friend is not
          the most trustworthy guy. Then, your coefficients are actually
          "probabalistic" variables, and not "deterministic" variables. Although
          the distribution from which these coefficients were drawn from may
          appear to be truly random (because your friend's mind is infinitely
          random), there are many numbers in nature that are actually drawn from
          bona fide probability distributions (normal, poisson, beta)... That's
          where the fun comes in. Because what happens when you do calculus with
        </p>
        <p>
          What about x and y and z, you ask? Well they can be drawn from
          distributions too. It's just that their values are literally not
          determined yet. But if you know which distribution they come from (say
          x is from a normal distribution), then you can have a better idea of
          how the equation behaves - because although the graph/function is
          valid over the whole domain of real numbers, the x value is from a
          distribution that is centered around a mean, and so you know in what
          regions of the graph y is more likely to be found. (Still thinking
          about y=2x+3). So then you can ask, what determines the valueu of the
          mean of x's distribution? I think that comes from historical
          data/domain knowledge. You can also ask, for what functions will the
          output variable still be of the same distribution as the input
          variable. Like for y= x^2/sin(x), will y be from a normal
          distribution?

        <h2>Life at Dartmouth: A Sophomore's Perspective</h2>
        <p class="post-date">July 20, 2025</p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on my sophomore year at Dartmouth, I'm amazed by how much
          I've grown both academically and personally. The combination of
          rigorous coursework in mathematics and computer science, along with
          the vibrant campus community, has shaped my perspective in ways I
          never expected...
